## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Modern web browser

### Setup Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SujitYalmar/Chaotic-Media-Encryption.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd Chaotic-Media-Encryption

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

---

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Upload**: Select or drag & drop your media files
2. **Encrypt**: Files are automatically encrypted using chaotic algorithms
3. **Share**: Receive a secure link to share with recipients
4. **Download**: Recipients decrypt and download files securely

### Example Code

```javascript
// Initialize encryption
const encryption = new ChaoticEncryption();

// Encrypt file
const encryptedData = encryption.encryptFile(fileData);

// Generate secure link
const shareLink = generateSecureLink(encryptedData);
```

## 🔒 Security

### Encryption Details

Our platform uses **chaotic encryption algorithms** based on chaos theory, which provides:

- **High Sensitivity**: Small changes in initial conditions produce vastly different outputs
- **Unpredictability**: Encryption patterns are extremely difficult to predict
- **Non-Linearity**: Resistant to traditional cryptanalysis methods
- **Key Space Complexity**: Enormous key space makes brute-force attacks impractical

### Best Practices

- ✅ Use strong passwords for additional file protection
- ✅ Enable auto-destruction for sensitive files
- ✅ Share links through secure channels
- ✅ Verify recipient identity before sharing
- ❌ Don't share encryption keys through the same channel as file links
